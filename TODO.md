- create a custom PPA for Travic CI that contains our cross-compiler. Needs to support more than one version of GCC, and should install GCC in it's own directory to prevent the native GCC from being removed
- redo the elf_loader unit test to use hippo mocks. Doing so will allow us to mock up a function's dependencis, allowing us to test each function's tasks better
- cleanup the elf_loader as it has newlines for function call in the header, which was abandoned.
