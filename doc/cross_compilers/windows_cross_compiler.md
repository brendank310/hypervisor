# Windows Cross Compiler

## Summary

The following describes how to create a cross-compiler for the Bareflank
hypervisor.

## Homebrew

Prior to being able to create the cross-compiler, you will need to install
Cygwin. Cygwin provides access to some prerequisites needed to compile GCC and
binutils. Note that some instructions online demonstrate how to compile these
prerequisites manually, a process that should be avoided as this cross-compiler
will be executing on the host, and thus should be as compatible with the host
as possible. Furthermore, Cygwin's native GCC compiler will be used to compile
the supporting applications for the hypervisor (i.e. unit tests, runtime host
applications, etc...).

[Cygwin Install Page](https://cygwin.com/install.html)

Donwload "setup-x86_64.exe" and execute it. Use all of the default settings
while installing Cygwin (you will also be asked to select a mirror). Once you
are given a list of packages to install, tell Cygwin to install the following
(by clicking "skip" which changes the text to a version number):

- wget
- make
- gcc-g++
- diffutils
- libgmp-devel
- libmpfr-devel
- libmpc-devel
- libisl-devel

Additionally, you may want to install:

- openssh
- vim
- cygrunsrv
- syslog-ng

Once all of the packages are selected for install, keep clicking next until
the installation is complete.

## Downloads

Before you can compile the cross-compiler, you must download it. For GCC, this
consists of both binutils and gcc itself. Note that you must select gcc 5.2.0
or higher, and binutils 2.25.1 or higher. All that is needed in this step are
the links for the compiler you choose to install, as we will complete the
actual download later.

## Compilation Environment

Before compilation can begin, you will be need to setup the compilation
environment. First, you must setup some environment variables. _NOTE_: The
Bareflank hypevisor uses these values (by default) to locate the
cross-compiler. Therefore we do not recommend that you change these values
unless you plan to provide the build environment with the location of the
cross-compiler.

Open a Cygwin terminal, and enter the following:

```
export PREFIX="$HOME/opt/cross"
export TARGET=x86_64-elf
export PATH="$PREFIX/bin:$PATH"
```

Next, you must create a working directory, download and unpack GCC and
binutils, and setup compilation folders for. __NOTE__: You must compile
binutils and gcc outside of their source directories as shown below.
Attempting to configure and compile them in their source directories will
result in compilation errors.

```
mkdir ~/cross
cd ~/cross

wget <link to gcc-*.tar.gz>
wget <link to binutils-*.tar.gz>
wget <link to nasm-*.tar.gz>

tar xvf gcc-*.tar.gz
tar xvf binutils-*.tar.gz
tar xvf nasm-*.tar.gz

mkdir build-gcc
mkdir build-binutils
```

## Compile binutils

To compile binutils, run the following:

```
cd ~/cross/build-binutils

../binutils-*/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix="$PREFIX" --with-sysroot --disable-nls --disable-werror

make
make install
```

Don’t use the “-j” option on make as it will error out (i.e. binutils and gcc
do not successfully compile in a multicore environment).

## Compile gcc

To compile gcc, run the following:

```
cd ~/cross/build-gcc

../gcc-*/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix="$PREFIX" --disable-nls --enable-languages=c,c++ --without-headers

make all-gcc
make all-target-libgcc
make install-gcc
make install-target-libgcc
```

## Compile NASM

To compile nasm, run the following:

```
cd ~/cross/nasm-*

./configure --prefix="$PREFIX"
make 
make install
```

## Test

The resulting cross-compiler should be located at:

```
~/opt/cross/bin/x86_64-elf-gcc
~/opt/cross/bin/x86_64-elf-g++
~/opt/cross/bin/x86_64-elf-ld
~/opt/cross/bin/nasm
```

## Additional Notes:

In addition to setting up the cross-compiler, you will also need to:

- Install and configure Visual Studio 2015 or higher
- Install and configure the WDK 10 or higher
- Install and configure the SDK 10 or higher
